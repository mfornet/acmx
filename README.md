-   [Manage testcases easily](https://github.com/mfornet/acmx/wiki/Test-Cases).
-   [Stress solution](https://github.com/mfornet/acmx/wiki/Stress-Testing) against brute solution using a generator (Useful to find corner cases).

## Documentation

Check [the wiki](https://github.com/mfornet/acmx/wiki) for details about all features and help.

## Getting started

**acmX** have been designed to run automatically boilerplate actions repeated often in competitive programming. Next is the expected pipeline to interact with it.

![Getting started](images/getting-started.gif)

1. Install the extension from the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marx24.acmx).

2. Install competitive companion.

3. Open online contest/problem you want to solve and parse with competitive-companion extension. All problems along with the testcases are downloaded and you are ready to code.

4. Work on your solution on `sol.cpp`.

5. After you finish call `Run` and automatically your program will be compiled and run against every testcases. If the solutions is correct, it will be reported as `Ok` otherwise you will see failing test case. You can always go back to original layout calling `View: Code`.
